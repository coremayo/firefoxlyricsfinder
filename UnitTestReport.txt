getPage 		- Pass
getLastFMSongTitle	- Pass
getLastFMSongArtist	- Pass

AZLyricSource		- Pass
DarkLyricsSource	- Pass

For the first three functions listed, we hardcoded test cases, which can be seen in our source code.

For the functions that parsed the AZLyrics and DarkLyrics sites, we used JSCoverage Test Framework, which 
allows us to track executed lines of code in our main.js file. We made a simple html page and called the 
functions, passing as parameters a song title and artist that is valid on each site. We are able to conclude 
the tests passed, as the JSCoverage interface showed that the lines of code in the functions that were executed 
did indeed correspond exactly with a successful run of the function. See the screenshots in the .doc file included 
in the zip package for a more detailed look.
